      <p class="paragraph">Families are cooking more at home worldwide and young people are increasingly making their own meals. However, not everyone are experienced in cooking; and it is often hard to manage the timing and temperature while cooking. Carbon is an iOS Application that makes everything easy. It uses bluetooth technology to connect to a uniquely built food thermostat that helps users to efficiently keep track of the temperature of their food, the app allows users to precisely calculate the temperature and time-left during cooking to ensure the food is prepared right under the desired temperature.

      <p class="paragraph">Our engagement with Carbon starts with a design project, we designed a user-friendly and easy-to-use, yet modern interface tailored to the hardware uniquely built. Then, we moved on to development of an iOS Application: Albert showed us the hardware and we developed an app the works well with it.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">We believed this application helps simplify the cooking process and we are excited to see how the product will evolve and create an impact in the community.
